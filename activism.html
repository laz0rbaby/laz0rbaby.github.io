<p>For the last 3 years I have been volunteer tutoring through the NYC branch of
the educational justice nonprofit <a href="https://www.peteygreene.org/"
  target="_blank">Petey
  Greene Program</a>.
PGP has matched me with programs such as <a
                                           href="https://www.exaltyouth.org/" target="_blank">Exalt Youth
                                           Program</a> 
and the <a href="https://justiceandopportunity.org/career-pathways/navigator/"
  target="_blank">John Jay Navigator Program</a>.

</p>

<p>Additionally, I cook for a mutual aid based in Bed-Stuy and East Harlem
called <a href="https://www.wethepeople.nyc/" target="_blank">We The
People</a>. The images on the right showcase some of the massive (40+ serving)
portions that I have cooked for WTP. For more information on how to get free
hot meals in East Harlem, check out the WTP website!
